This Hotel Manager Application basically was a project I had to do for my C# course this time im using dynamic arrays instead and saves me hours of time 
Choose which room with the numbers allocated, each room is priced according to how luxury the room is
after selecting you enter how many nights and the program does all the math and outputs your answer
